> [!CAUTION]  
> This pup does not have a stable release yet.

This pup will install [Dogecoin Core](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin) as a pup on your node.

It will install with a disabled wallet (at compile time) and no UI.

It will also start automatically syncing the blockchain, meaning you may require `~300gb` of free disk space.
